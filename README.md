### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial Series: 
###[Adaptive Blog Theme: From Photoshop to HTML & CSS](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/adaptive-blog-theme-from-photoshop-to-html-css--webdesign-9242) 
#### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/author/adrian/)

Word of warning: this Session is not for the faint-hearted! Throughout the course of nearly fifty screencasts Adi Purdila will walk you through conception and completion of an entire WordPress blog theme. You'll start out in Photoshop, translate the design into an adaptive HTML and CSS build, then jump over to the next section (Adaptive Blog Theme: From HTML & CSS to WordPress) where you'll rig everything up with WordPress.

There's rarely a better way of learning web design than to watch over someone's shoulder for the duration of a complete project; this is your chance to do just that.
